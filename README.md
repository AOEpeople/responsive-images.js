Responsive image replacement
============================

resonsive-img.js is a lightweight plugin for fast, clean and easy responsive image replacement using to the viewport your visitor's browser. 
This way you can reduce the payload for your users by only letting them download the appropriate images for their device.

Have a look at the blog post [here](http://blog.kvendrik.com) for a more in-depth description.


Usage
-----

####Setting it up

To start using the plugin we only have to include the script in the footer of our document.

	<script src='responsive_img-min.js'></script>


####HTML Structure

In the `data-src` attribute we specify the different breakpoints in combination with the image source it should use. In the `data-src-base`(optional) attribute we specify the base of our source urls.

	<img alt='kitten!' data-src-base='images/' data-src='<400:200.jpeg,
														 >400:400.jpeg,
														 >1000:600.jpeg,
														 >1240:800.jpeg' />

Using the HTML above the browser would load images/200.jpeg if the size of the viewport is below 400 pixels, images/400.jpeg if the size of the viewport is above 400 pixels and below 1000 pixels, images/600.jpeg if the size of viewport above 1000 pixels and below 1240 pixels and images/800.jpeg if the size of viewport above 1240 pixels.

Let's also create a fallback for non-javascript browsers:

	<noscript><img alt='kitten!' src='images/400.jpeg' /></noscript>

That's all! We're up and running! ;)
